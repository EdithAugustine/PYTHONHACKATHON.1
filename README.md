# Python Hackathon Project

This repository contains Python scripts developed for a hackathon project. Below are brief descriptions of each script:

## Fibonacci Sequence

The `fibonacci.py` script generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms. It prompts the user to input the number of terms they want to generate and then outputs the corresponding sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, where each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

## Voting Eligibility Checker

The `vote_eligibility.py` script checks whether a person is eligible to vote based on their age. It prompts the user to input their age and then determines if they are eligible to vote (age 18 or older) or not eligible (age below 18).

Feel free to explore the scripts and use them for your own projects or learning purposes!
